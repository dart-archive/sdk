This directory is a split repo overlay for the LK kernel found at

https://github.com/travisg/lk

that contains the dartino specific parts to build a dartino vm that can run as
an app within the LK kernel. The kernel is located in
'third_party/lk/lk-downstream'.

To build a image containing the dartino VM, run, in third_party/lk,

  make

to build the default target for qemu emulation or, e.g.,

  make PROJECT=stm32746g-eval2-dartino

to build for the stm32746g evaluation board. Other project names are available
as .mk files in third_party/lk/dartino/project
