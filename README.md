# An update on Dartino

_September, 2016._

The Dartino project has been [discontinued](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dartino-discuss/U3fzZjoOdKg), and is no longer being actively maintained by the Dart team.

If you are interested in the source code, please look on GitHub:

  * Core SDK:
  [https://github.com/dartino/sdk](https://github.com/dartino/sdk)
  * Atom IDE plugin:
  [https://github.com/dartino/atom-dartino](https://github.com/dartino/atom-dartino)
  * dartino.org website:
  [https://github.com/dartino/www.dartino.org](https://github.com/dartino/www.dartino.org)

The team behind Dartino is doubling down on other areas of development:

  * Making [Dart webdev](https://webdev.dartlang.org) the most productive stack for web apps
  * Making [Flutter](https://flutter.io) the best way of building high-quality cross-platform mobile apps

Regards, the Dartino team
